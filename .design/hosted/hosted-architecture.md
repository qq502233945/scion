# Hosted Scion Architecture Design

## Status
**Proposed**

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the architecture for transforming Scion into a distributed platform supporting multiple runtime environments. The core goal is to separate the **State Management** (persistence/metadata) from the **Runtime Execution** (container orchestration).

The architecture introduces:
*   **Scion Hub (State Server):** A centralized API and database for agent state, groves, templates, and users.
*   **Groves (Projects):** The primary unit of registration with the Hub. A grove represents a project/repository and is the boundary through which runtime hosts interact with the Hub.
*   **Runtime Hosts:** Compute nodes with access to one or more container runtimes (local Docker, Kubernetes cluster, etc.). Hosts expose functionality *through* their registered groves, not as standalone entities.

This distributed model supports fully hosted SaaS scenarios, hybrid local/cloud setups, and "Solo Mode" (standalone CLI) using the same architectural primitives.

### Key Architectural Principle: Grove-Centric Registration

The **Grove** is the fundamental unit of Hub registration, not the Runtime Host. When a local development environment or server connects to a Hub, it registers one or more groves. This design reflects the reality that:

1. **Groves have identity** - A grove is uniquely identified by its git remote URL (when git-backed). This provides a natural deduplication mechanism.
2. **Hosts are ephemeral** - Developer laptops come and go; what matters is the project they're working on.
3. **Groves can span hosts** - Multiple developers (runtime hosts) can contribute agents to the same grove.
4. **Profiles are per-grove** - Runtime configuration (Docker vs K8s, resource limits) is defined in grove settings.

### Modes

#### Solo
The scion CLI operates in its traditional local way. State storage is in the form of files in the agent folders and labels on running containers. No Hub connectivity.

#### Read-Only (Reporting)
The grove is registered with a Hub for visibility, but the Hub cannot control agent lifecycle. The local CLI/Manager remains the source of truth and reports state changes to the Hub:
*   Local state files remain authoritative
*   The `sciontool` dual-writes status to both local state and Hub
*   Commands like `scion list` consult local state
*   A background daemon maintains the Hub connection and sends heartbeats
*   The Hub can observe agents but not create/start/stop/delete them

#### Connected (Full Control)
The grove is fully managed through the Hub. The Hub has complete control over agent lifecycle:
*   Hub is the source of truth for agent state
*   The Hub can create, start, stop, and delete agents on behalf of users
*   Multiple runtime hosts can contribute to the same grove
*   Web-based PTY and management are available

## 2. Goals & Scope
*   **Grove-Centric Registration:** Groves are the unit of registration with the Hub. Runtime hosts register the groves they serve.
*   **Git Remote as Identity:** Groves associated with git repositories are uniquely identified by their git remote URL. This ensures a single Hub grove maps to exactly one repository.
*   **Distributed Groves:** A single grove can span multiple runtime hosts (e.g., multiple developers working on the same project).
*   **Centralized State:** Agent metadata is persisted in a central database (Scion Hub), enabling cross-host visibility.
*   **Flexible Runtime:** Agents can run on local Docker, a remote server, or a Kubernetes cluster. Runtime configuration is defined per-grove in profiles.
*   **Unified Interface:** Users interact with the Scion Hub API (or a CLI connected to it) to manage agents across any host.
*   **Web-Based Access:** Support for web-based PTY and management for hosted agents.

### Server Components

The distributed Scion platform consists of three server components, all implemented in the same binary:

| Component | Port | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Runtime Host API** | 9800 | Agent lifecycle on compute nodes |
| **Hub API** | 9810 | Centralized state, routing, coordination |
| **Web Frontend** | 9820 | Browser dashboard, OAuth, PTY relay |

See `server-implementation-design.md` for detailed server configuration.

### Registration Flow

    participant Host as Runtime Host
    participant Hub as Scion Hub
    participant DB as Database

    Host->>Hub: Register Grove (git remote, path, profiles)
    Hub->>DB: Lookup grove by git remote
    alt Grove exists
        DB-->>Hub: Existing grove record
        Hub->>DB: Add host as contributor
    else Grove is new
        Hub->>DB: Create grove record
        Hub->>DB: Add host as contributor
    end
    Hub-->>Host: Grove ID + Host Token
```

## 4. Core Components

### 4.1. Scion Hub (State Server)
The central authority responsible for:
*   **Persistence:** Stores `Agents`, `Groves`, `Users`, and `Templates`.
*   **Grove Registry:** Maintains the canonical registry of groves, enforcing git remote uniqueness.
*   **Host Tracking:** Tracks which runtime hosts contribute to each grove.
*   **Routing:** Directs agent operations to the appropriate runtime host(s) within a grove.
*   **API:** Exposes the primary REST interface for clients.

### 4.2. Grove (Project) — The Registration Unit
The grove is the **primary unit of registration** with the Hub. A grove represents a project, typically backed by a git repository.

*   **Identity:** Groves with git repositories are uniquely identified by their normalized git remote URL. This is enforced at the Hub level.
*   **Distributed:** A grove can span multiple runtime hosts. Each host that registers the same grove (identified by git remote) becomes a contributor.
*   **Default Runtime Host:** Each grove has a default runtime host (`defaultRuntimeHostId`) that is used when creating agents without an explicit host. This is automatically set to the first runtime host that registers with the grove.
*   **Profiles:** Runtime configuration (Docker vs K8s, resource limits, etc.) is defined per-grove in the settings file. Hosts advertise which profiles they can execute.
*   **Hub Record:** The Hub maintains:
    *   Grove metadata (name, slug, git remote, owner)
    *   Default runtime host ID for agent creation
    *   List of contributing hosts
    *   Aggregate agent count and status

### 4.3. Runtime Host
A compute node with access to one or more container runtimes. Hosts do not register themselves as standalone entities; instead, they register the groves they serve.

*   **Grove Registration:** On startup (or on-demand), a host registers one or more local groves with the Hub.
*   **Runtime Providers:** Access to one or more runtimes:
    *   **Docker/Container:** Local container orchestration
    *   **Kubernetes:** Cluster-based pod orchestration
    *   **Apple:** macOS virtualization framework
*   **Profile Execution:** Hosts advertise which grove profiles they can execute based on available runtimes.
*   **Operational Modes:** (See Section 1)
    *   **Connected:** Hub has full agent lifecycle control
    *   **Read-Only:** Hub can observe but not control
*   **Agent Communication:** Configures the `sciontool` inside agents to report status back to the Hub.

### 4.4. Scion Tool (Agent-Side)
The agent-side helper script.
*   **Dual Reporting:** Reports status to the local runtime host *and* (if configured) the central Scion Hub.
*   **Identity:** Injected with `SCION_AGENT_ID`, `SCION_GROVE_ID`, and `SCION_HUB_ENDPOINT`.

### 4.5. Web Frontend
The browser-based dashboard for user interaction. Detailed specifications are in `server-implementation-design.md`.

*   **Static Assets:** Serves the compiled SPA (embedded in binary or from filesystem).
*   **Authentication:** Handles OAuth login flows (Google, GitHub, OIDC) and session management.
*   **Hub Proxy:** Optionally proxies API requests to the Hub API, simplifying CORS and auth.
*   **PTY Relay:** Proxies WebSocket PTY connections from browsers to the Hub/Runtime Hosts.
*   **Deployment:** Typically deployed alongside the Hub API; can be deployed separately if needed.

## 5. Detailed Workflows

### 5.1. Grove Registration
1.  **Runtime Host** starts up or user runs `scion hub link`.
2.  **Runtime Host** reads local grove configuration (path, git remote, profiles).
3.  **Runtime Host** calls Hub API: `POST /groves/register` with:
    *   Git remote URL (normalized)
    *   Grove name/slug
    *   Available profiles and runtimes
    *   Host identifier and capabilities
4.  **Scion Hub**:
    *   Looks up existing grove by git remote URL.
    *   If found: adds this host as a contributor to the existing grove.
    *   If not found: creates a new grove record with this host as the initial contributor.
    *   If the grove has no `defaultRuntimeHostId`, sets this host as the default.
    *   Returns grove ID and host authentication token.
5.  **Runtime Host** stores the grove ID and token for subsequent operations.

### 5.2. Agent Creation (Hosted/Distributed)
1.  **User** requests agent creation via Scion Hub API, specifying grove and optionally a `runtimeHostId`.
2.  **Scion Hub** resolves the runtime host:
    *   If `runtimeHostId` is explicitly provided, verify it's a valid, online contributor to the grove.
    *   Otherwise, use the grove's `defaultRuntimeHostId` (set when the first host registers).
    *   If the resolved host is unavailable or no host is configured, return an error with a list of available alternatives.
3.  **Scion Hub**:
    *   Creates `Agent` record with the resolved `runtimeHostId` (Status: `PENDING`).
    *   Sends `CreateAgent` command to the Runtime Host.
    *   Updates status to `PROVISIONING` on successful dispatch.
4.  **Runtime Host**:
    *   Allocates resources (PVC, Container) according to the selected profile.
    *   Starts the Agent.
    *   Injects Hub connection details.
5.  **Agent**:
    *   Starts up.
    *   `sciontool` reports `RUNNING` status to Scion Hub.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User/CLI
    participant Hub as Scion Hub
    participant DB as Database
    participant Host as Runtime Host

    User->>Hub: POST /agents (groveId, [runtimeHostId])
    Hub->>DB: Get grove + contributors
    DB-->>Hub: Grove (defaultRuntimeHostId) + online hosts

    alt runtimeHostId specified
        Hub->>Hub: Verify host is online contributor
    else use default
        Hub->>Hub: Use grove.defaultRuntimeHostId
    end

    alt host unavailable
        Hub-->>User: 422/503 + availableHosts list
    else host available
        Hub->>DB: Create agent (status: pending, runtimeHostId)
        Hub->>Host: DispatchAgentCreate
        Host-->>Hub: Success
        Hub->>DB: Update status: provisioning
        Hub-->>User: 201 Created + agent
    end
```

### 5.3. Web PTY Attachment
1.  **User** connects to Scion Hub WebSocket for a specific agent.
2.  **Scion Hub** identifies which Runtime Host is running the agent.
3.  **Scion Hub** proxies the connection to the Runtime Host via the control channel.
4.  **Runtime Host** streams the PTY from the container.

### 5.4. Standalone Mode (Solo)
*   The Scion CLI acts as both the **Hub** (using local file DB) and the **Runtime Host** (using Docker).
*   No Hub registration or external network dependencies required.
*   Can be upgraded to Read-Only mode by configuring a Hub endpoint.

## 6. Environment Variables & Secrets Management

The hosted architecture includes a centralized system for managing environment variables and secrets that can be scoped to users, groves, or runtime hosts. These values are securely stored by the Hub and injected into agents at runtime.

### 6.1. Scope Hierarchy

Environment variables and secrets are resolved using a hierarchical scope system. When an agent starts, values are merged in the following order (later scopes override earlier):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Resolution Order                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                  │
│   1. User Scope (lowest priority)                               │
│      └── Variables/secrets defined for the current user         │
│                                                                  │
│   2. Grove Scope                                                 │
│      └── Variables/secrets defined for the grove                │
│                                                                  │
│   3. Runtime Host Scope                                         │
│      └── Variables/secrets defined for the specific host        │
│                                                                  │
│   4. Agent Config (highest priority)                            │
│      └── Variables explicitly set in agent creation request     │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example Resolution:**
```
User scope:      API_KEY=user-key, LOG_LEVEL=info
Grove scope:     API_KEY=grove-key, PROJECT_ID=my-project
Host scope:      LOG_LEVEL=debug
Agent config:    PROJECT_ID=override

Result:          API_KEY=grove-key, LOG_LEVEL=debug, PROJECT_ID=override
```

### 6.2. Data Model

#### EnvVar (Environment Variable)

```json
{
  "id": "string",              // UUID
  "key": "string",             // Variable name (e.g., "API_KEY")
  "value": "string",           // Variable value

  "scope": "string",           // user, grove, runtime_host
  "scopeId": "string",         // ID of the scoped entity (userId, groveId, hostId)

  "description": "string",     // Optional description
  "sensitive": false,          // If true, value is masked in UI/logs

  "created": "2025-01-24T10:00:00Z",
  "updated": "2025-01-24T10:30:00Z",
  "createdBy": "string"        // User ID who created this
}
```

#### Secret

Secrets are write-only values that cannot be retrieved after creation. They follow the same scoping rules as environment variables but have additional security constraints.

```json
{
  "id": "string",              // UUID
  "key": "string",             // Secret name (e.g., "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

  "scope": "string",           // user, grove, runtime_host
  "scopeId": "string",         // ID of the scoped entity

  "description": "string",     // Optional description
  "version": 1,                // Incremented on each update

  "created": "2025-01-24T10:00:00Z",
  "updated": "2025-01-24T10:30:00Z",
  "createdBy": "string",
  "updatedBy": "string"
}
```

**Note:** The `value` field is intentionally omitted from Secret responses. Secrets are never returned via the API after creation.

### 6.3. Storage

#### Initial Implementation (Clear-Text)

The initial implementation stores values directly in the database:
*   **Environment Variables:** Stored in clear-text in the `env_vars` table
*   **Secrets:** Stored in clear-text in the `secrets` table (future: encrypted)

#### Future Improvements

1. **At-Rest Encryption:** Secrets encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a key derived from a master secret
2. **Key Management Service:** Integration with cloud KMS (GCP KMS, AWS KMS)
3. **External Secret Backends:**
   *   HashiCorp Vault
   *   GCP Secret Manager
   *   AWS Secrets Manager

### 6.4. CLI Interface

The CLI provides commands for managing environment variables and secrets at different scopes.

#### Environment Variables

```bash
# User scope (current authenticated user)
scion hub env set FOO bar                    # Set user-scoped variable
scion hub env get FOO                        # Get specific variable
scion hub env get                            # List all user variables
scion hub env clear FOO                      # Delete variable

# Grove scope
scion hub env set --grove <grove-id> FOO bar # Explicit grove ID
scion hub env set --grove FOO bar            # Infer grove from current directory
scion hub env get --grove <grove-id> FOO     # Get grove variable
scion hub env get --grove                    # List grove variables
scion hub env clear --grove FOO              # Delete grove variable

# Runtime Host scope
scion hub env set --host <host-id> FOO bar   # Explicit host ID
scion hub env set --host FOO bar             # Use current machine as host
scion hub env get --host <host-id> FOO       # Get host variable
scion hub env get --host                     # List host variables
scion hub env clear --host FOO               # Delete host variable
```

#### Secrets

Secrets follow the same pattern but use the `secret` subcommand. Note that `get` only returns metadata, never the secret value.

```bash
# User scope
scion hub secret set API_KEY <value>         # Set user-scoped secret
scion hub secret get API_KEY                 # Get metadata (no value)
scion hub secret get                         # List all user secrets
scion hub secret clear API_KEY               # Delete secret

# Grove scope
scion hub secret set --grove API_KEY <value> # Set grove-scoped secret
scion hub secret get --grove                 # List grove secrets
scion hub secret clear --grove API_KEY       # Delete grove secret

# Runtime Host scope
scion hub secret set --host API_KEY <value>  # Set host-scoped secret
scion hub secret get --host                  # List host secrets
scion hub secret clear --host API_KEY        # Delete host secret
```

#### Grove and Host Inference

When `--grove` or `--host` is specified without an ID:
*   **Grove:** Inferred from the current git repository's remote URL, or from `.scion/settings.yaml` if a grove ID is stored locally
*   **Host:** Inferred from the current machine's hostname or stored host ID in local settings

### 6.5. Agent Injection Flow

When an agent is created, the Hub resolves and injects environment variables and secrets:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User/CLI
    participant Hub as Scion Hub
    participant DB as Database
    participant Host as Runtime Host
    participant Agent as Agent

    User->>Hub: POST /agents (groveId, config)
    Hub->>DB: Get user env/secrets
    Hub->>DB: Get grove env/secrets
    Hub->>DB: Get host env/secrets
    Hub->>Hub: Merge by scope priority
    Hub->>Hub: Apply agent config overrides
    Hub->>Host: DispatchAgentCreate (merged env)
    Host->>Agent: Start container with env vars
    Agent-->>Host: Running
    Host-->>Hub: Status: running
    Hub-->>User: 201 Created
```

The merged environment is passed to the Runtime Host as part of the `CreateAgent` command. The Runtime Host then injects these values into the agent container.

### 6.6. Security Considerations

1. **Secrets are write-only:** The API never returns secret values after creation
2. **Audit logging:** All secret access and modifications are logged with user attribution
3. **Scope isolation:** Users can only manage secrets for resources they own or have write access to
4. **Transport security:** All API communication uses TLS
5. **Secret masking:** Secret values are masked in logs, UI, and error messages
6. **Rotation support:** Secrets can be updated in place; version tracking enables rollback

### 6.7. Access Control

| Operation | User Scope | Grove Scope | Host Scope |
|-----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Create/Update | Owner only | Grove owner/admin | Host owner/admin |
| Read (env) | Owner only | Grove members | Host contributors |
| Read (secret metadata) | Owner only | Grove members | Host contributors |
| Read (secret value) | Never via API | Never via API | Never via API |
| Delete | Owner only | Grove owner/admin | Host owner/admin |

## 7. Migration & Compatibility
*   **Manager Interface:** The `pkg/agent.Manager` will be split/refined to support remote execution.
*   **Storage Interface:** Introduce `pkg/store` interface to abstract `sqlite` (local) vs `firestore` (hosted).
