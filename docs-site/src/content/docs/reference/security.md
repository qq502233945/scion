title: Security Architecture
description: Comprehensive overview of Scion's security model, including authentication, transport security, and permissions.
---

Scion is designed with a multi-layered security model to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of agent operations, user data, and system communications. This document outlines the authentication mechanisms, transport security protocols, and future authorization plans for the Scion platform.

## 1. Authentication Model

Scion operates in multiple contexts, each with specific security requirements. Authentication is managed centrally by the **Scion Hub**, which resolves identities for users, agents, and infrastructure components.

### 1.1 Authentication Contexts

| Context | Client Type | Auth Method | Token Storage |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Web Dashboard** | Browser | OAuth 2.0 + Session Cookie | HTTP-only cookie |
| **CLI (Hub Commands)** | Terminal | OAuth 2.0 + Device Flow | `~/.scion/credentials.json` |
| **Agent (sciontool)** | Container | Hub-issued JWT | Env Var (`SCION_HUB_TOKEN`) |
| **Runtime Broker** | Compute Node | HMAC Signature | `~/.scion/broker-credentials.json` |
| **Development** | Any | Dev Token (Bearer) | `~/.scion/dev-token` |

### 1.2 User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)

For both Web and CLI access, Scion relies on standard OAuth 2.0 providers (Google and GitHub).

- **Web Flow**: Standard Authorization Code flow. The Koa-based web frontend handles the callback and exchanges the provider token for a session-bound Hub access token.
- **CLI Flow**: Uses a localhost callback server (defaulting to port `18271`). The CLI opens the user's browser for authentication and receives the authorization code via the local server.
- **PKCE**: The CLI uses Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) to prevent authorization code injection attacks.

### 1.3 Agent Authentication (`sciontool`)

Agents running inside containers must report status back to the Hub without possessing user-level credentials.

- **Hub-Issued JWT**: During provisioning, the Hub generates a short-lived JWT scoped specifically to that agent instance.
- **Claims**: The token includes the `agent_id` (sub) and `grove_id`.
- **Scopes**: Standardized scopes include:
    - `agent:status:update`: Allows reporting progress and heartbeats.
    - `agent:log:append`: Allows streaming logs back to the Hub.
    - `grove:secret:read`: Allows the agent to retrieve grove-scoped secrets.
- **Transmission**: The token is injected into the container via the `SCION_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable and is used by `sciontool` for all API calls.

### 1.4 Runtime Broker Authentication (HMAC)

Runtime Brokers represent high-trust infrastructure. They use HMAC-based request signing for bidirectional authentication with the Hub.

- **Shared Secret**: Established during initial registration via a short-lived `joinToken`.
- **Signing**: Every request includes headers for `X-Scion-Broker-ID`, `X-Scion-Timestamp`, `X-Scion-Nonce`, and `X-Scion-Signature`.
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based tracking and timestamp validation (5-minute clock skew tolerance) prevent replay attacks.
- **NAT Traversal**: Brokers establish a persistent WebSocket control channel. The initial upgrade request is HMAC-authenticated, establishing a trusted session for subsequent commands.

## 2. Transport Security

### 2.1 TLS and HTTPS Enforcement

In production mode, Scion mandates the use of TLS for all network traffic.

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: The Hub server rejects non-HTTPS requests (unless configured for local development or behind a trusted TLS-terminating proxy).
- **Security Headers**: Standard headers such as `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS), `X-Frame-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy` are enforced.
- **mTLS (Future)**: Support for Mutual TLS between Hub and Runtime Brokers is planned for high-security environments.

### 2.2 WebSocket Security

- **CLI/Agents**: Use standard `Authorization` headers.
- **Browser/Web**: Since browser WebSocket APIs cannot set custom headers, Scion uses a **Ticket-Based Authentication** system. The client requests a short-lived, single-use ticket via a POST request (authenticated by cookie) and provides it in the WebSocket query string (`?ticket=...`).

## 3. Authorization and Access Control

### 3.1 Domain Authorization

Scion supports restricting authentication to specific email domains via the `SCION_AUTHORIZED_DOMAINS` configuration. This provides a first-line defense, ensuring only authorized organization members can access the Hub.

### 3.2 Permissions System (Future Plans)

A comprehensive, hierarchical RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system is currently in the design phase. For a detailed technical specification of the policy language and agent identity claims, see the [Policy & Permissions Reference](/reference/permissions-policy).

- **Principal-Based**: Permissions are granted to **Users** and **Groups**.
- **Hierarchical Groups**: Groups can contain other groups, allowing for complex team structures.
- **Resource Scopes**: Policies are attached to scopes (Hub, Grove, or specific Resource) and follow a containment hierarchy.
- **Override Model**: Lower-level policies (e.g., at the Agent level) override higher-level ones (e.g., at the Grove level), allowing for granular delegation of authority.
- **Actions**: Standardized CRUD actions (`create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `list`) plus resource-specific actions (`start`, `stop`, `attach`, `message`).

## 4. Secret Management

### 4.1 API Keys

For headless environments (CI/CD, automation), Scion supports **API Keys**.
- Keys are prefixed with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`.
- Only the hash of the key is stored in the database.
- Keys can be scoped to specific permissions and revoked instantly via the dashboard.

### 4.2 Credentials Propagation

Scion ensures that sensitive credentials (GCP Service Accounts, API keys for LLMs) are propagated into agent containers securely.
- **Docker**: Injected via environment variables or read-only volume mounts.
- **Kubernetes**: Propagated via Kubernetes Secrets or Secret Manager CSI drivers (e.g., GCP Secret Manager).
- **Isolation**: Agent home directories are isolated on the host filesystem to prevent cross-agent credential leakage.

## 5. Development Security

To facilitate local development, Scion provides a **Development Authentication** mode.
- **Dev Token**: A persistent token starting with `scion_dev_` stored in `~/.scion/dev-token`.
- **Constraints**: Dev mode is disabled by default and requires `localhost` binding if TLS is not used.
- **Warning**: The server logs clear warnings when operating in Dev Mode.
