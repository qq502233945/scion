title: Authentication & Identity
description: Configuring authentication flows for Scion.
---

Scion implements a unified authentication system designed to secure communication between all components: the CLI, the Web Dashboard, the Hub, and individual Agents.

## Identity Types

Scion recognizes four primary identity types:

1.  **Users**: Humans interacting via the CLI or Web Dashboard. Authenticated via OAuth or Development tokens.
2.  **Agents**: Running LLM instances. Authenticated via short-lived JWTs issued by the Hub during provisioning.
3.  **Runtime Hosts**: Infrastructure nodes that execute agents. Authenticated via Host tokens.
4.  **Development User**: A special identity used for local development and zero-config testing.

## Authentication Methods

Scion supports multiple authentication methods for different use cases:

- **OAuth (Google/GitHub)**: For production web and CLI authentication.
- **Development Auth**: For local development and testing.
- **API Keys**: For programmatic access and CI/CD pipelines.

## OAuth Authentication

Scion supports OAuth authentication via Google and GitHub. OAuth credentials are configured separately for web and CLI clients due to different redirect URI requirements.

### Web OAuth Setup

Configure web OAuth with these environment variables:

```bash
export SCION_SERVER_OAUTH_WEB_GOOGLE_CLIENTID="your-client-id"
export SCION_SERVER_OAUTH_WEB_GOOGLE_CLIENTSECRET="your-client-secret"
export SCION_SERVER_OAUTH_WEB_GITHUB_CLIENTID="your-client-id"
export SCION_SERVER_OAUTH_WEB_GITHUB_CLIENTSECRET="your-client-secret"
```

### CLI OAuth Setup

Configure CLI OAuth with these environment variables:

```bash
export SCION_SERVER_OAUTH_CLI_GOOGLE_CLIENTID="your-client-id"
export SCION_SERVER_OAUTH_CLI_GOOGLE_CLIENTSECRET="your-client-secret"
export SCION_SERVER_OAUTH_CLI_GITHUB_CLIENTID="your-client-id"
export SCION_SERVER_OAUTH_CLI_GITHUB_CLIENTSECRET="your-client-secret"
```

## Domain Authorization

You can restrict authentication to specific email domains using the `SCION_AUTHORIZED_DOMAINS` setting. This provides an additional layer of access control beyond OAuth authentication.

### Configuration

Set the environment variable with a comma-separated list of allowed domains:

```bash
# Allow only users from these domains
export SCION_AUTHORIZED_DOMAINS="example.com,mycompany.org"
```

Or configure in `server.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  authorizedDomains:
    - example.com
    - mycompany.org
```

### Behavior

- **Empty list (default)**: All email domains are allowed.
- **Non-empty list**: Only emails from listed domains can authenticate.
- **Case insensitive**: `Example.COM` matches `example.com`.
- **Exact match**: Subdomains must be listed explicitly.

## Development Authentication (Dev Auth)

To minimize friction during local setup, Scion includes a "Dev Auth" mode. When enabled, the Hub auto-generates a token and creates a "Development User" identity.

### Enabling Dev Auth
Start the server with the `--dev-auth` flag or set it in your `server.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  devMode: true
```

Or via environment variable:
```bash
export SCION_SERVER_AUTH_DEVMODE=true
```

### Using the Dev Token
When the Hub starts with `devMode: true`, it writes the token to `~/.scion/dev-token`.
- **CLI**: The `scion` CLI automatically looks for this file.
- **Web**: The Web Dashboard automatically uses this token for the "Development User" login when `SCION_DEV_AUTH_ENABLED=true` is set.

Alternatively, you can set the token in your environment:
```bash
export SCION_DEV_TOKEN=scion_dev_...
```

## CLI Authentication

Users can authenticate the CLI against a Scion Hub using the following flow:

1.  **Login**: `scion hub login` opens a browser to the dashboard login page.
2.  **Exchange**: After successful login, the dashboard provides a token (or the CLI exchanges a code).
3.  **Storage**: The token is stored in `~/.scion/config.json`.

## Agent Authentication

Agents are automatically authenticated. When the Hub dispatches an agent to a Runtime Host, it includes a one-time-use **Agent Token**.
- The agent uses this token for all calls back to the Hub (e.g., updating status, streaming logs).
- Tokens are scoped to the specific agent and its grove.
- Tokens have a default expiration (typically 24 hours).

## API Keys

For programmatic access (e.g., CI/CD pipelines), the Hub supports API Keys.
- Keys can be generated via the Web Dashboard or CLI.
- Keys are prefixed with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`.
- Use the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header or `X-API-Key` header in your requests.
